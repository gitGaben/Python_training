    "In Python, to create iterators, we can use both regular functions and generators. Generators are written just like a normal function but we use yield() instead of return() for returning a result. It is more powerful as a tool to implement iterators. It is easy and more convenient to implement because it offers the evaluation of elements on demand. Unlike regular functions which on encountering a return statement terminates entirely, generators use a yield statement in which the state of the function is saved from the last call and can be picked up or resumed the next time we call a generator function. Another great advantage of the generator over a list is that it takes much less memory. "
