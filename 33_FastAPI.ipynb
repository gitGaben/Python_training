    "# What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. It serves as a bridge, enabling the exchange of data and functionality between different software systems. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. APIs create conveniences for end users and developers alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "The APIs must be clearly distinguished from a user interface. The user interface accepts data from users, forwards it to the application for processing, and returns the results to the user. The API does not interact with the user, but processes the data received from one program module and transmits the results back to the other module."

    "\n",
    "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is like a waiter at a restaurant. It's the intermediary that allows different software applications to communicate and share information, just as a waiter helps you communicate your order to the kitchen and delivers your food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're at a restaurant. The menu is like an API; it lists the dishes (services) available for you to order. You (the client) decide what you want, and the waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server), bringing back the food (data) you requested.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Menu (API Documentation):** The menu describes what dishes (services) are available and how to order them. Similarly, API documentation outlines what functions or data a software application provides and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order (API Request):** When you decide to order a dish, you're making a request. In the software world, this is an API request. You ask the API for specific information or to perform a certain action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kitchen (Server):** The kitchen prepares the food based on your order. In the software world, the server processes your API request, performs the necessary actions, and sends back the requested data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Waiter (API):** The waiter takes your order, communicates it to the kitchen, and brings you the food. In the software world, the API acts as the waiter, facilitating communication between your application and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Food (Data):** The food represents the information or results you requested. This is the data sent back by the server in response to your API request.\n"

    "**There are four different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP APIs:** These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. Client and server exchange messages using XML. This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RPC APIs:** These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Websocket APIs:** Websocket API is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data. A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional HTTP connections, which are request-response based and stateless, WebSocket APIs allow for bidirectional communication between a client and a server in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "WebSocket APIs enable both the server and the client to send messages to each other independently. This bidirectional communication allows for real-time updates, notifications, and data exchange without the need for continuous polling.\n",
    "\n",
    "WebSocket communication is designed for low-latency interactions. The connection is established once, and subsequent messages can be sent with minimal latency, making it suitable for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications, online gaming, and financial trading platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "WebSocket APIs are commonly used in various scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time Chat Applications: WebSocket APIs enable instant message delivery and real-time chat interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Live Streaming: WebSocket is used for real-time updates and live streaming of data, such as stock market prices or sports scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online Gaming: Multiplayer online games often utilize WebSocket for low-latency communication between players and the game server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Editing: Applications that involve real-time collaboration, such as document editing or drawing, benefit from WebSocket for synchronized updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST APIs:** These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client. Let’s look at REST APIs in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of REST API is statelessness. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page."

    "Private APIs: These are internal to an enterprise and only used for connecting systems and data within the business.\n",

    "\n",
    "FastAPI fully supports asynchronous programming using Python's async and await syntax. This allows developers to write asynchronous code for improved concurrency and performance.\n",

    "Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that is used to run asynchronous web applications, including those built with FastAPI. It is a lightweight and fast server that supports asynchronous request handling, making it well-suited for the asynchronous nature of FastAPI. It also supports WebSocket communication, and this is crucial for FastAPI applications that include WebSocket functionality. FastAPI can handle WebSocket connections, and Uvicorn is responsible for serving these WebSocket connections."
