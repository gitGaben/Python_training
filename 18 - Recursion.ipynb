    "Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem in terms of smaller instances of the same problem. In other words, a recursive function is a function that performs a task in part and delegates the remaining task to a new invocation of itself. The process continues until a base case is reached, at which point the function returns a result without making further recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems until theyâ€™re small enough to manage. In programming, recursion is usually expressed by a function calling itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion uses more memory, because the recursive function adds to the stack with each recursive call, and keeps the values there until the call is finished. The recursive function uses LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) \n",
