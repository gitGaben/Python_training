    "# Monkeypatch\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of software testing, a monkeypatch is a technique used to dynamically modify or override functions or methods at runtime. The purpose of monkeypatching is often to replace or modify certain behaviors during testing without modifying the actual source code. It allows you to temporarily alter the behavior of functions or methods to suit the needs of your tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a typical scenario where monkeypatch can be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a function that relies on an external service, and you want to test this function in isolation without making actual network requests. Instead of modifying the function's code, you can use monkeypatch to temporarily replace the external service call with a mock or stub during testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the pytest testing framework provides a built-in monkeypatch fixture that you can use to modify attributes, override functions, or set environment variables during tests."

Use monkeypatch.delattr to remove the function or property for the test. \n",
