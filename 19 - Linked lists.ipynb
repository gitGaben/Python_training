    "In computer science, a linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains two components: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the list typically has a reference to None, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists provide a flexible way to organize and store data, especially when the size of the data is not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists differ from simple lists in regard of how they store elements in memory. While lists use a contiguous memory block to store references to their data, linked lists store references as part of their own elements. The data items could be stored anywhere in the memory, they will be able to find each other through reference (memory address).\n",

    "**Contiguous memory:** \n",
    "\n",
    "It refers to a block of computer memory in which multiple items (such as variables or elements of an array) are stored in a continuous sequence of addresses. In other words, the memory locations for these items are adjacent to each other in a linear fashion. This is in contrast to non-contiguous memory, where the memory locations are scattered or not adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contiguous memory is like having a row of houses where each house has its own unique address, and all the houses are lined up next to each other on the same street. In the computer's memory, these \"houses\" represent storage locations for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have an array of numbers in contiguous memory, it means the numbers are stored one after another in adjacent memory locations. This arrangement makes it easy to find and access the numbers because they are right next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, non-contiguous memory would be like having houses scattered on different streets. The data is stored in separate, disconnected locations, which can make it a bit trickier to manage and access quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, contiguous memory is all about things being neatly lined up in a sequence, making it convenient for the computer to work with that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Contiguous memory has several advantages, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Access: Because the memory locations are sequential, accessing items in contiguous memory can be more efficient in terms of both time and resources. This is especially true for arrays and data structures where elements are accessed in a sequential manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache Performance: Contiguous memory access tends to make better use of CPU caches. Modern processors often utilize caching mechanisms that load chunks of contiguous memory into the cache, improving access times for subsequent reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler Memory Management: Memory management is generally simpler with contiguous memory, as it allows for straightforward allocation and deallocation of blocks of memory. This is in contrast to non-contiguous memory, which may involve more complex memory management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are also limitations to contiguous memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragmentation: Contiguous memory can lead to fragmentation, especially in systems where memory is allocated and deallocated dynamically. Over time, free memory may become fragmented into smaller, non-contiguous blocks, making it challenging to allocate large contiguous chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Flexibility: Contiguous memory requires a fixed and continuous block of addresses, which may limit flexibility in memory allocation compared to non-contiguous memory systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher Risk of Memory Overflow: If the contiguous block of memory is not properly managed, there is a higher risk of memory overflow (running out of memory) if the required contiguous space is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contiguous memory is commonly used in scenarios where efficient sequential access is important, such as in arrays, matrices, and certain data structures. It's also a common memory organization approach in many programming languages."

    "Insertion and Deletion of Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can insert elements into a list using .insert() or .append(). For removing elements from a list, you can use their counterparts: .remove() and .pop().\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between these methods is that you use .insert() and .remove() to insert or remove elements at a specific position in a list, but you use .append() only to insert elements at the end of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, something you need to know about Python lists is that inserting or removing elements that are not at the end of the list requires some element shifting in the background, making the operation more complex in terms of time spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this in mind, even though inserting elements at the end of a list using .append() or .insert() will have constant time, O(1), when you try inserting an element closer to or at the beginning of the list, the average time complexity will grow along with the size of the list: O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists, on the other hand, are much more straightforward when it comes to insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning or end of a list, where their time complexity is always constant: O(1). (Only when you use doubly linked lists! In case you use single linked list, then the insertion/deletion at the beginning of the list will be O(1), at the end of the list O(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, linked lists have a performance advantage over normal lists when implementing a queue (FIFO), in which elements are continuously inserted and removed at the beginning of the list. But they perform similarly to a list when implementing a stack (LIFO), in which elements are inserted and removed at the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval of Elements\n",
    "When it comes to element lookup, lists perform much better than linked lists. When you know which element you want to access, lists can perform this operation in O(1) time. Trying to do the same with a linked list would take O(n) because you need to traverse the whole list to find the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for a specific element, however, both lists and linked lists perform very similarly, with a time complexity of O(n). In both cases, you need to iterate through the entire list to find the element you’re looking for."
